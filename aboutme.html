          <h2>About me</h2>
          <h4>Summary Statement</h4>
          <p>I am 25 years old and am currently interested in pursuing a career
          in computer programming. I have a degree in physics and math and
          enjoy solving problems that involve a mix of creativity and
          quantitative skills. I work well in a team and value being in an
          environment that emphasizes communication and outside the box thinking.
          </p>
          <h4>Work Experience</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Physics/Math Tutor, Self-Employed (01/16-05/16).</p>
              <p>I tutored a mix of Portland State University and high school
              students in physics and math. My greatest strength was
              making complex topics accessible to lay people who did not have a
              strong background in the natural sciences.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Insurance Salesman, Wes Prater Farmers Agency (08/15-12/15)</p>
              <p> I sold property and casualty insurance over the phone and in
              person for a small Farmers agency. I also helped servive existing
              customers with changing coverages, filing claims and paying bills.

            <li>
              <p>Physics/Math Tutor, Self-Employed (01/2015-06/2015)</p>
              <p>I tutored undergraduate physics students at the University of
              Oklahoma. I emphasized clear communication and being thoroughly
              knowledgable about the given topic.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Graduate Research Assistant, University of Oklahoma Physics Dept.
              (06/2012-01/2015)</p>
              <p>I worked in the lab of Dr. Jim Shaffer assisting on experiments
              in the realm of cold atom physics and spectroscopy. I was assigned
              specifically to the <em>Rydberg Atom Cavity QED</em> experiment,
              where I tuned lasers, aligned optics, and built and calibrated
              equipment. I was exposed to programming here, primarily in C++,
              which we used to automate aspects of the data collection.

          <h4>Education</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>B.A., Physics and Math, Kenyon College. 2012</li>
            <li>Certificate of Completion, Epicodus, November 2016</li>

          <h2>Why Programming?</h2>
          <p>What I enjoy most about programming is that I get to build
          something, but I am not constrained by many of the physical limitations
          that one encounters when trying to create an object in 'real' space. I
          also enjoy the mix of quantitative skills and creativity required to
          be a good programmer. Finally, I see it as a rapidly growing and
          in-demand profession, which makes it appealing as well.</p>

          <h2>Other Interests</h2>
          <p>I enjoy playing disc golf quite a bit. It's something I got into a
          little over a year ago and quickly fell in love with. The Oregon area
          is great for the sport and has some of the best courses on earth. It
          was host to the <strong>2014 PDGA World Championships</strong>. I play Diplomacy and
          Mafia (a.k.a Werewolf) over the internet. Both of those games
          emphasize communication skills, critical reading, and deception
          which is what drew me to them. I like hanging out with friends and
          consider myself a pretty social person.</p>
